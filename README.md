This gihub repository reproduces the results of the study:

"Higher degree of food processing relates to more anemic consumers"

The main reproduction code is labeled as: "MAIN_github_code_Approach_1_and_2_results_for_each_p_value.R" - this reproduces statistical differences in logit(p) (63 feature value) plus size of NA and A, and standardized (95% CI stand.) difference in means, with difference in means (63 feature value) and 95% CI error margin (additional 63 feature value) yielding a vector of 191 values for ecah case and outcome.
